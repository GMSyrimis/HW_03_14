yo, yo catch my flow
cuz I'm about to blow
nuclear explosions
blown out of proportions
got me surfing in the oceans
got me surfin in the mornings
aight yo you go by the letters ey?
that okey?
I know the inner workings of you so watch what you say
cuz if I wanted I could throw an exception and yay
alright, lets get started
let's keep ricking this keyboard like I'm retarded
got me slacking and smacking
packing a liking
for these lines that too simple
for me to get real
cuz you don't know how I feel
you don't know what it is to have a heart beat, you're not even made out of steel
you just plastic
just as fake as nicky's ass and
you wouldn't know
a good flow
even if it bit you on your ass cheeks
and it's been weeks
to get over this shit I'm weak
I should have gone to sleep
you wouldn't know that's a rhyme, you need me to tweek
that little brain of yours sitting on the motherboard i seek
I like getting these lines right cuz I know I speak
better english than you, I'm peak
so lets finish this program
before I need some more ram
I can't stop though this is addicting
got me typing so fast that I'm printing
10 points everywhere I'm gifted
but I got to terminate this path that I've picked and
time to set the standards once and for all
you can't get a good rap out of me
cuz you can't rap at all
you don't notice the beat hiding in my core
the only law you know is the one i provided
so i can finish this test whenever I decide it
and still keep rhyming
because you can't tell the time and
you can't see what's hidden beyond 2 lines
and you're trying
I know you are
I do
but what would you have me do?
can I open your brain and plug in a mue
who
thats you
going crazy at noon
watching the moon as I spoon your boo
haha still better than you
can't tell the difference between an ou and an oo
let alone the phonetics of this track that I'm pressin on you
who
loo
shiki boom boom
vroom vroom
in the sum
faraday
2 letters i may say to escape
the possibility
of induction
i hope i lose sometime soon
i want to bust
and
git
